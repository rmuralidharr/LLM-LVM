      "Dr , I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my strong interest in the BAIS (Business Analytics and Information Systems) Masters program at University of South Florida (USF). Although I am aware that the application deadline has passed, I would like to request special consideration for late admission due to my circumstances. I recently graduated from the USF in December, majoring in the same field, Information Studies. Since then, I have been eagerly waiting to start my career and have applied for Optional Practical Training (OPT) to work in the United States. However, given the current economic conditions, I have been unable to land a job yet and was considering going for masters. As luck would have it, I am currently in Tampa, where USF is located, and I am awaiting a job opportunity. Having researched extensively, I am impressed with the esteemed faculty, rigorous curriculum, and excellent reputation of USF's BAIS Masters program. I am confident that this program aligns perfectly with my academic and career goals, and I am highly motivated to contribute to the diverse academic community at USF.

I wanted to know more about the application requirements. Namely regarding the resume requirement, GMAT test scores, and Letters of Recommendation. What would the recommended amount of work experience be for this program? Due to my Bachelor's degree being in Business Administration I do not have much professional experience in data analysis or related fields. However, I have taken personal strides to learn more about analysis and have completed certificates in order to prepare myself for this program. For the GMAT/GRE Test scores, would it be possible for me to acquire a test score waiver based off of my previous GPA (3.87)? As for the letters of recommendation, is there a standardized form you would like me to use or are personalized recommendations favored?

I have checked the course outline, However, I want to further inquire about the program, I am a student with a background in BS Media Science, and I have zero coding experience. However, I am familiar with coding, as I had a course in computer science at my O level. What would I expect from this program? What challenges will I be facing in this program and what are the required skills to have as a plus point for this program? Is this program more focused on research and theory rather than technical skills? and what major would you prefer to a student? Considering the job market in the present and future, what role could I play with this program?

The Office of Admissions does not require the GRE or GMAT scores for official admission to the University; however, many of our graduate programs do have this requirement.

Thank you, From:    Sent: Wednesday, April 5, 2023 10:26 AM To:  ;  ; USF Financial Aid ; ; BSN Newsletter ;  ;  ;  ;  ;   Subject: ,  Withdraw from ISM 6124 - Adv Systems Analysis/Design and master's in Business Analytics and Information Systems. To All Concerned, This is my official notification of withdrawal from ISM 6124 - Adv Systems Analysis/Design and Masters in Business Analytics and Information Systems program. I have grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of ability to reach certain people and areas of USF and/or have a response returned if I am capable of reaching individuals or offices. Wrong phone numbers listed on the USF website and directory increase frustration. The lack of response from professors and academic advisor frustration has compounded and led to my withdrawal from the course and program. As I have attempted several times on the USF website to drop my course, there is a hold for what the financial aid office says is an incomplete application. Again, another frustration. I have no idea what an incomplete application means as I was admitted to this program. I leave it to everyone on this email to drop me from this course and program. I will be pursuing a master's at another institution. This will act as my official withdrawal on April 05, 2023.  \n",

After working for a year, I decided to take the Master’s program in Business Analytics and Information Systems to gain more knowledge and understanding in this field. I know that the semester of Fall 2023 will start in August, so I am just wondering whether it is late to start applying for the program. Moreover, as mentioned above, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in BAIS at USF with a GPA of 3.95, so I am unsure whether I am eligible for a waiver of the GRE/GMAT exam. Finally, regarding the recommendation letters, I am thinking if it is possible to have both letters from co-workers. Thank you so much for reading my message. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

      "Hello, My name is  (U22261933) and was admitted to the Fall 2023 class for the MS in BAIS. I am familiar with OASIS and the course registration process, however I’d like to understand better how these courses are structured for this program. More specifically:  Would they generally be 6-8 week classes throughout the entire program?  If so, would they overlap or would they be taken one class at a time per semester? I also wanted to inquire about the following: Given that I’m currently enrolled in the Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics, am I able to take any courses this upcoming summer semester (such as ISM 6251 – Data Science Programming) so that it could apply to either my Graduate Certificate or apply as a credit to the masters program. I understand that if I enroll for this course this summer that I may be classified as a non-degree seeking student, but would like to know if this is still a possibility. I look forward to hearing back from you! Thank You, \n",
      "Hi , In general, the courses in the MS BAIS program run over most of the semester (12 or 16 weeks) but there are a few that you can take in 8 weeks. However, this will be the minority. If you are interested in doing the courses back-to-back, then the Global BAIS program might be more appropriate. There is information on this program on the MS BAIS web site at  and the contact person is Dr  () No matter whether you enroll in the regular program, or the Global program, any courses that you take in the Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics will transfer, although we have to make sure we do the paper work when you start the program proper. I hope that this helps. Han , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",
      "Hi Dr. , Thank you for the detailed response. Would the regular MS BAIS program also contain fully remote or after 5pm classes to fit the schedules of full-time workers or is that only offered via the Global BAIS program? I can contact Dr  to get more information on the Global BAIS, but I am interested in the flexibility that the regular MS BAIS program offers when choosing electives and courses am not sure if the Global option will allow for this. Additionally, I would like to take a course (ISM 6565 – Fundamentals of Mgmt and Analysis) over this summer. I am aware that this isn’t an elective that is available in the catalog for the MS in BAIS program or the Graduate Certificate, is there a way for me to get confirmation that this course could substitute one of my future elective credits for the MS BAIS program if I take it over the summer of 2023 or apply as a substitute credit to complete my Graduate Certificate? Thank you for the help, \n",
      "Hi, The MS BAIS program offers some courses online and after 5:00pm. I just cannot guarantee that you will be able to complete all your courses with online or after 5:00. I would recommend that you talk with Dr . There are electives in the Global program as well but not quite as many as in the regular MS BAIS program. You cannot use ISM6565 as an elective in the MS BAIS (or ) program. It is too low level and we in fact use it as one of the options for students to satisfy their database pre-program prerequisite. Han , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",
      "Dr. , Thank you for this information. I will get in contact with Dr.  to better understand their Global program. As a final note, would courses like ESI 6612 – Statistical Foundations of Data Intelligence, ESI 6613 Applied Data Intelligence, or COP 6712 – Database Management Systems qualify as an elective substitute for the MS BAIS/GBAIS program?

During this period, I actively participated in various analytics projects, acquiring practical skills and knowledge directly applicable to the program's coursework. Considering my experience, I kindly request your consideration for a GMAT waiver. I am confident that my professional background and accomplishments adequately demonstrate my readiness and ability to excel in the program. Furthermore, I am interested in understanding the curriculum variations between the weekend program and the global executive program. Clarifying the differences would help me determine which program best aligns with my goals, career aspirations, and personal commitments. I would greatly appreciate any information or guidance you can provide regarding the GMAT waiver process and the curriculum differences between the programs. If needed, I am available for a phone call or meeting to discuss this matter further. Thank you for your time and attention to my inquiry. I eagerly await your response and the opportunity to join the Business Analytics and Science program at your esteemed institution. Sincerely,  912.678.2920\n",
      "Hi, As it states on the web site, we can only waive the GMAT requirement if your experience is in the US. If it is, no problem. There are no differences as far as the curriculum is concerned between the two programs. However, the  is more of an executive program and will therefore put a greater emphasis on the use of the technology in business, even if this comes a little at the expense of covering the technology.

I am writing to inquire about the possibility of enrolling in the EIS class for the summer semester 2023, despite the registration period being closed. I recently received an exciting internship offer from an employer, and there is a possibility of this opportunity leading to a full-time position upon my graduation in December 2023.

      "Sir, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request course registration adjustment for the first semester Fall 2023. I would like to drop one class with CRN No 80145 and add two additional subjects with CRN No's 80127(Mining) and 80125 (Advanced Systems Analysis & Design) to my schedule. Firstly, I would like to drop the class with CRN No 80145 which is Mining. Upon further consideration, I realized that there is no significant time gap between this class 80145 (Mining) and the subsequent class I wanted to enroll in with CRN No 80125 ( Advanced Systems Analysis & Design ). This gap has created scheduling conflicts and has made it challenging for me to effectively manage my time and commitments. Therefore, I believe it would be more beneficial for me to drop this class with CRN no 80145( Mining ) and seek an alternative class with CRN 80127 ( Mining ) that aligns better with my schedule. Considering this, I would like to add two subjects to my schedule. The first subject is with CRN No 80127 which focuses on data mining. Adding this subject will create a more cohesive schedule. Additionally, I would like to add the subject with CRN No 80125 ( Advanced Systems Analysis & Design ). By enrolling in this subject, I will be able to explore another area of interest that complements my program of study. Importantly, adding this subject will create a more balanced schedule and allow for an appropriate time difference between my fourth subject with CRN 80125 and the data mining class with CRN 80127. This will enable me to fully engage and excel in both courses without feeling overwhelmed. I have reviewed the course descriptions, prerequisites, and time schedules for both subjects, and I am confident that these adjustments will enhance my learning experience and contribute positively to my academic progress. I understand that any changes to my class schedule are subject to availability and approval. I kindly request your assistance in facilitating these adjustments. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I greatly appreciate your support and guidance throughout my academic journey. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, \n",
      "Hi, Thank you for your request. We made a mistake when we registered you. Since you have not yet completed the Stats prerequisite, the advisor should not have registered you for QMB 6304, and I have therefore removed it from your schedule.

I recently received the mail that I have been placed on the waitlist, and I wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm my strong desire to be part of the USF community. Being placed on the waitlist has only intensified my determination to join the incoming class at USF. I have taken the time to carefully assess my options, and I firmly believe that USF is the perfect institution to foster my academic and personal growth. The MS BAIS program and the cutting-edge resources available to students are particularly compelling to me, as they align perfectly with my academic interests and long-term career aspirations. I would like to assure you that if given the opportunity, I will fully immerse myself in the academic rigors of USF. I am eager to engage in collaborative discussions, participate in research endeavors, and contribute to the campus community through my unique perspective and experiences. Additionally, I have an unwavering commitment to excellence, a strong work ethic, and a genuine passion for lifelong learning, which I believe will contribute positively to the vibrant academic atmosphere at USF. I understand that the admissions process is highly selective, and the waitlist exists to ensure a diverse and well-rounded incoming class. Although I appreciate the challenges faced by the admissions committee in making final decisions, I kindly request that you carefully reconsider my application for admission. I genuinely believe that I will thrive within the unique academic and social environment that USF offers, and I am prepared to fully embrace the opportunities and responsibilities that come with being a member of the USF community.

      "Hi, Greetings for the day! I have a query related to the course registrations. I am aware there are emails related to the courses registrations, but my case is slightly different. I have completed 22 credits now and left with 11 credits for my graduation. I am planning to complete my graduation in Fall 2023. Now, for this summer I have registered for 2 courses – EISM and Warehousing. There is a chance of getting an internship this summer probably in the next 2 or 3 weeks. I am going through my interview process now for the internship. So, my query is can I register for these 2 courses and add the internship in the middle of the semester? Because as per the previous emails, I could only do 1 course with the internship in the summer semester. What should be done in this situation? Please guide me professor. Thanks for the help. . Varun.\n",
      "Hi, Your situation is not different: If you want to do a full-time internship, you can take only one course in the Summer. The course announcement on the MS BAIS Current Students Canvas course is very clear about this. Han , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",
      "Hi professor , I am not sure on getting the internship in this summer. What if I have 2 courses and got an opportunity in the middle of semester. Will the college be accepting the internship and 2 courses. Because I want to work on Data Wearhousing course which will be very useful for my near future. If I drop one of my course and didn't get any opportunity for the internship, then I couldn't complete my graduation for this fall 23. I am trying to complete my graduation for this fall 23. Thanks, Varun.\n",

      " and , I hope this email finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to express my interest in pursuing an MS degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida, as well as a request for funding or a graduate assistantship. I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about my background, my profile, the need for this degree, my eligibility for a graduate assistantship, and my financial constraints. I am from a small and beautiful country, Nepal. I studied at a community school in my hometown and came third in class 10th, a school-leaving examination. Something I am very proud of is that I am the first computer engineer from my hometown, and I want to take this further by achieving an MS degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida. I am highly motivated to work on the application of deep learning to big data analytics and find solutions to the challenges involved. As deep learning can be utilized in big data to address problems such as extracting complex patterns from massive volumes of data, semantic indexing, data tagging, fast information retrieval, and simplifying discriminative tasks, it can bring breakthroughs in big data research. Though deep learning has been utilized in speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully utilize deep learning in big data analytics. I would like to work on issues such as scalability, interpretability, and security so that we can fully harness the power of deep learning in big data analytics. I will be very thrilled and excited to work on these amazing research areas related to the program. My background includes a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. To be honest, though my overall CGPA was not the best due to university calendar issues, the 2015 earthquake, the border blockade, and other reasons, I got an A in artificial intelligence. After completing my bachelor’s degree, I kicked off my career in the fields of data engineering, data warehousing, data analysis, and business intelligence. I was involved in some pioneering projects in the business intelligence domain in Nepal's private sector. Over the past five years, I have worked on numerous data-related projects of different magnitudes, and especially while working in a bank and at Alibaba Group's e-commerce, an immensely data-driven company with big data technology, I have acquired tremendous knowledge in the field. I am interested in pursuing an MS degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida because of the international exposure and education it would provide, which I seriously need at this point in my career, as well as the fact that big data analytics is the new revolution that will take humanity to new levels. Despite being a country with a low economy, there are many MNCs operating in that utilize big data and futuristic technologies such as AI, and this will only increase in the coming years. Moreover, I believe my degree would be of great value for my home country, where data-driven decision-making is still in its infancy. After completing the program, I plan to work as an educator, sharing my knowledge and expertise with the next generation of data enthusiasts. I believe I am an excellent fit for a graduate assistantship because I have a related degree in computer engineering and have gained not exactly the same but similar experience over the past five years in the data sector. More specifically, I have a very good knowledge of academic research writing. I have taken 20+ hours of courses related to research methods and approaches. Additionally, having lived in different parts of the country as a student and a worker and transacted with people from all walks of life, I possess strong communication, collaboration, and leadership skills. I am a proficient user of English with demonstrated IELTS Academic CEFR level C1. As I truly believe in lifelong learning, I have completed various courses related to IT, business, and management that would definitely add value while working as a graduate assistant. Moreover, I have also taken extensive and specific courses related to the program, such as for Science and Learning Bootcamp, SPSS Statistics Essential Training, and many others. Unfortunately, I am facing financial challenges as I do not come from a very strong financial background, and my savings were spent on funding my brother’s education. Therefore, I am seeking opportunities for funding or a graduate assistantship that would enable me to pursue my dream of obtaining an MS degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems. I would be very grateful if you could guide me in securing one of the funding sources, and after that, I will be able to move forward confidently with my university application. I am fully aware that a graduate assistantship requires a significant amount of learning and extra hours of hard work. However, I am dedicated and determined to put in the effort. I have also attached a CV for your reference. Thank you very much for your time. I look forward to hearing back from you. Sincerely,   LinkedIn here\n",

I was asked to reach out to Prof.  from the MS of BAIS team about my application. I got accepted to the MS in BAIS Program at USF for 2022 as I was completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in USF. As I got offered a job in the field, I had to step away from the university for a little to gain experience in the tech field. Currently, I am planning to join USF for the MS in BAIS program. I was wondering if my previous application can be used as I have already been accepted, or if I need to reapply. I know the deadline for international students are in February, but as I am already situated in the United States, I do not need extra time for VISA purposes (just the I-20 will suffice if accepted). I really prefer to start in Fall 2023 if there are seats available, but if not then I will look towards Spring 2024. That being said, I hope you can consider my application in the MS in BAIS program. I have already been a part of USF throughout my undergraduate program and have had multiple opportunities working with professors and being a TA, which has helped me grow a lot. Now, I want to join back and pursue my passion in the tech field along with the business values. I have been accepted in a few other schools but my heart belongs to USF. Please let me know if anything can be done or additional information is required from my end. I look forward to hearing back from you soon. Best Regards   U72881435\n",

      "Dear Admission Advisor, Greetings of the day! I trust this email finds you well. I write with a humble request for an application fee waiver for my admission to your distinguished university. As a prospective student hailing from Pakistan, I have been grappling with the ramifications of the current economic situation, which has been marked by an alarming surge in inflation and an unpredictable fluctuation in the rates of the dollar. Regrettably, these circumstances have made it a daunting task for me to manage the expenses associated with application fees for the numerous universities I have applied to. Despite my prudent budgeting, I am dismayed to realize that I am unable to defray the fees for the remaining universities, which necessitates my plea for your compassionate consideration. Permit me to state unequivocally that I am an exceptional candidate, possessing a proven track record of academic excellence, as well as a distinguished set of personal attributes that align seamlessly with the values espoused by your esteemed institution. My academic acumen is exemplified by the successful completion of my Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of the People, which is an American accredited university online. Furthermore, my distinguished work as a Relationship Management Executive for Choice Limited, a UK-based MSB company, has conferred upon me an unparalleled professional experience and a richly diversified perspective that would undoubtedly benefit the entire university community. Thus, it is with utmost gratitude that I implore your kindness to consider my request for an application fee waiver, given the exceptional circumstances highlighted earlier. With your indulgence, I assert that I would be a valuable addition to your academic community, committed to making significant contributions to the esteemed institution. Moreover, I would like to seek clarification on whether my credentials are sufficient to exempt me from the English proficiency requirement. Given my proven academic excellence, combined with extensive professional experience, I am confident that my English language proficiency is exemplary and meets the required standards. I, therefore, humbly urge you to consider this fact in your deliberations and provide the necessary exemption. Finally, I would like to inquire about the possibility of being exempt from the GMAT or GRE requirement. My academic background, as well as professional experience, makes me confident that I possess the requisite skills and knowledge to excel in the program. It is my fervent hope that my credentials are satisfactory to merit exemption from this requirement. In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your attention to my request for an application fee waiver and seek your understanding and consideration on the issues raised. I eagerly anticipate your pronto response. Yours sincerely, \n",

      "Hello, I took QNT/275T Statistics for Decision Making. Can this be used to waive the statistics prerequisite? Regarding database design, I have not taken an academic course on this but have extensive experience with relational databases, specifically with SQL Server Management Studio and MS Access, during my time at Wells Fargo Bank. I performed DBA duties such as writing complex queries using common table expressions and sub-queries and performing query optimization with indexes, and I have a firm grasp of predicate logic and set theory, which are core tenants of SQL. I will fulfill the required prerequisites as instructed, but I wanted to ensure the extent of my professional experience and exposure to database design was sufficiently considered. Thanks, \n",
      "Hi , Thanks. I will waive the DB prerequisite based on your experience. I saw it on your resume but I was not quite clear what you had done. As far as the Stats prereq is concerned, can you send me the syllabus for this course? Thanks – Han , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",
      "Han, find attached the course syllabus. I concede it does read slightly underwhelming, but I recall the course delved into more complex concepts such as using R to calculate P-values and testing for statistical significance. But again, I have no qualms about fulfilling whatever is required in order to address the prerequisites. Thanks,   (0.0 kB)\n",
      "Hi , I do not want to be a pain about this but I would feel more comfortable if you took one of the Stats courses. Stats is so central to our program and I want to make sure we set you up for success. I hope that that is OK. Han\n",

      "Hi, Thanks for sending the certificates. You have now met all prerequisites. I have also enrolled you for the first three classes. Can you check in OASIS? If you need classes at different times/days, let me know and I can change it. Also, although we strongly recommend against it, if you want to take a fourth course, let me know. I would recommend that you take ISM 6124 - Advanced Systems Analysis and Design. I look forward to seeing you on campus in the Fall.

      "Is it possible to switch to the following configuration? Mining - ISM 6136 - 005 CRN 80154 (Tuesday 06:30 pm-10:15 pm) Advanced Management - ISM 6218 - 006 CRN 80277 (Online) Methods for Business - QMB 6304 - 006 CRN 80683 (Online) My only concern is that the Mining in-person course only has three registrations so far and may end up getting canceled which will likely require me to take 82132 or 80440 instead which are offered online. My hard constraint for any in-person class is that it needs to be in the evening, and my aim is to only take one class in person each semester to maximize my VA benefits. Please advise your thoughts on this approach and whether this registration configuration can be implemented. Thanks, \n",
      "Hi , I have changed the Advanced Database course but the other sections that you are asking for are not open to MS BAIS students, and all the classes that we would normally ask students to take are during the day. We can change the order in which you take classes to accommodate your requests, but this may complicate things in the future. I am in particular concerned about QMB 6304 as we are not offering this class in the Spring. There is a ISM 6136 class in the Spring but that is scheduled for the afternoon as well. The best option I can think of at the moment is that you take the QMB 6304 class face-to-face during the Fall (we can move you into the section that accommodates your schedule best) and that we add an online Advanced Systems Analysis and Design class. In the Spring, you would then have to take ISM 6136 on campus, and we can then, at that stage, discuss the classes to add. Let me know what you think. Han , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",
      "Ok. How much of a pickle have I got myself in? My original intent for this program was to take a mix of night and online classes, but clearly, I miscalculated as it's become obvious some of these courses are only offered in person in the morning or afternoon during the week. I just checked with my employer and adjusting my work schedule to accommodate in-person classes at these hours is not feasible. At this point, I see no path forward to pursue the MS in Business Analytics & Information Systems program and my only route is through the Global Master of Science - Business Analytics & Information Systems instead. Do you concur that this is the only viable path given my constraint? (only able to entertain evening or online courses) If so, then it appears I'll have to disenroll from this program and wait until the Summer of 2024 (assuming I get accepted) to start the global version. This has completely blown up in my face. It's so disappointing I didn't pay more attention to the selective classes only open to MS BAIS students. \n",

I was asked to reach out to Prof.  from the MS of BAIS team about my application. I got accepted to the MS in BAIS Program at USF for 2022 as I was completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in USF. As I got offered a job in the field, I had to step away from the university for a little to gain experience in the tech field. Currently, I am planning to join USF for the MS in BAIS program. I was wondering if my previous application can be used as I have already been accepted, or if I need to reapply. I know the deadline for international students are in February, but as I am already situated in the United States, I do not need extra time for VISA purposes (just the I-20 will suffice if accepted). I really prefer to start in Fall 2023 if there are seats available, but if not then I will look towards Spring 2024. That being said, I hope you can consider my application in the MS in BAIS program. I have already been a part of USF throughout my undergraduate program and have had multiple opportunities working with professors and being a TA, which has helped me grow a lot. Now, I want to join back and pursue my passion in the tech field along with the business values. I have been accepted in a few other schools but my heart belongs to USF.

      "Hello there, I hope you are having a great day. I was asked to reach out to Prof.  from the MS of BAIS team about my application. I got accepted to the MS in BAIS Program at USF for 2022 as I was completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in USF. As I got offered a job in the field, I had to step away from the university for a little to gain experience in the tech field. Currently, I am planning to join USF for the MS in BAIS program. I was wondering if my previous application can be used as I have already been accepted, or if I need to reapply. I know the deadline for international students are in February, but as I am already situated in the United States, I do not need extra time for VISA purposes (just the I-20 will suffice if accepted). I really prefer to start in Fall 2023 if there are seats available, but if not then I will look towards Spring 2024. That being said, I hope you can consider my application in the MS in BAIS program. I have already been a part of USF throughout my undergraduate program and have had multiple opportunities working with professors and being a TA, which has helped me grow a lot. Now, I want to join back and pursue my passion in the tech field along with the business values. I have been accepted in a few other schools but my heart belongs to USF. Please let me know if anything can be done or additional information is required from my end. I look forward to hearing back from you soon. Best Regards Abrar  U72881435\n",

It is mentioned on the program website (USF) that a GRE waiver is available for applicants based on experience criteria. I believe I am eligible for the GRE waiver as I have 3 years of relevant full-time work experience in the analytics field. I am attaching my experience letter, appointment letter and resume for your reference. For the last 3 years, I have worked in a highly competitive environment of analytics. This field requires an incredible amount of mental endurance in decision-making. Due to this my extensive work experience in business-related fields, I respectfully request a waiver for the GRE requirement. If I need to fill out a separate form for the GRE waiver, kindly share the link to the form. Thank you very much for your consideration of my request.

      "Subject: Graduate Major Dear Admission Committee, With due respect, my name is .  ( Reference Number VZ1277065,  USF ID: U51149404  ) I am writing to request a change in my major at the University of South Florida. As you may already know, I have been eagerly waiting to join the University for the past year as it has been my dream to study there. Unfortunately, the non-STEM program I was enrolled in did not meet my expectations and I am now seeking a change in my major. Since management information systems is not a STEM program, I am currently enrolled in it. I think that this course is not a good fit for me and my career goals as a student hoping to work in the STEM fields. I have a passion for learning new technologies and want to ensure that I am getting the best training possible in this area. I'll have the chance to learn more complex ideas and gain useful experience in this field if I pursue a STEM degree. So, if you could make accommodations for my circumstance and change my current course of study, I would be very appreciative. In light of this, I am kindly requesting that you allow me to switch my course ( Business Analytics & Information Systems ) to one that is more suitable for my goals and interests. I am confident that changing my major will provide me with the opportunity to achieve my academic and career goals. I respectfully request that you allow me to change my course as soon as possible.

Just wanted to let you know that I would like to take all of my remaining 4 courses and complete my graduation this Fall 23 semester. Hence, I would request you keep my 4 courses and let me know your thoughts if it is otherwise possible. Question – Can I take 2 credits for an internship course for Fall 23 semester so that I can one course from the four courses registered now? Thank you, Regards, . \n",
      "Professor , Adding to the previous email, my summer internship at  company got extended till December 2023. I’m planning to complete my graduation because my manager at  told me that they might extend a full-time opportunity after Fall 23 internship, and because of this I need to be in a position to work full-time starting from January 2024 and complete my graduation next semester. Thank you, Regards, .\n",
      "Hi, You can take at most 12 credit hours in a semester, and the internship is always 1 credit. So, it is not clear how you would be able to graduate at the end of the Fall semester while doing the internship. You would have been better advised to take an additional course in the Summer. There is one other option and that is that you try to get into Lean Six Sigma course. It runs in the week before the semester and we therefore would not count this towards the 12 credits in the regular semester. However, the course is more expensive. The MS BAIS Current Students Canvas course gives details. Han , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",
      "Professor, Initially I was not sure if internship gets extended and that was the reason why I did not take any subject for summer. However, fortunately now it got extended. Can we just not take 13 credits including the internship credit ? 1st option - So I will take four courses -43=12 credits. Plus, additional one credit for internship. Total 13. Can we do this by requesting some approval or filling in some form saying that I will be responsible for my studies and credits and will make sure to complete it. 2nd option - I will take 3 courses of each 3 credits, one 2 credit course and one credit from internship. Will this work ? I am just thinking out loud and exploring as many options as possible. Let me know your thoughts so that it will help me in making a decision. Thank you so much for your help and advice in this matter. That really helps. Best Regards, . \n",
      "Hi, 12 credit hours is a hard limit. I do not want to set a precedent by allowing you to break it. The second option is therefore the only viable option but, as far as I can tell, there are no 2 credit courses that you could count towards your degree. The only 2 credit course that I know of would be an independent studies course but we do not allow you to take an internship, an independent studies course, and 3 other courses.

I will register you for that course, and issue the permit once you let me know which of the courses you are currently enrolled in you want to drop.

      "Dr. , I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a couple of changes to my course registration for the upcoming semesters. For the Fall 2023 semester, I would like to register for the course CRN 82280 - Decision Processes for Business Continuity & Recovery and internship credit. Additionally, I have been offered an internship opportunity at Mercedes, which I am very excited about. However, it requires me to travel, and attending the in-person EIS class on Mondays would be challenging for me. Therefore, I kindly request your assistance in changing my in-person EIS class from Monday to Friday. This change will significantly ease my commute and allow me to fully focus on both my internship and academic commitments. Looking ahead to the Spring 2024 semester, I would like to register for the Lean Six Sigma course and internship credit. By doing so, I will be able to acquire all 33 credits needed for my degree by the end of the spring semester. This will provide me with enough time for my full-time job search prospects in my last semester. I greatly appreciate your consideration and support in accommodating these changes. Please let me know if any further action or documentation is required from my end to proceed with these adjustments. Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your positive response. Best regards, \n",
      "Hi, I have changed the EIS section you are enrolled in but the rest of your registration is problematic. You are enrolled in two independent studies courses, and you cannot do an independent studies course and register for other classes if you have an internship.

      "I emailed Professor  about this and I dropped my plan to do an independent study with him. So, I only be taking classes and full time internship and I won’t be registering for any independent study in my next semesters. \n",
      "Dr. , Considering the value of the internship opportunity and the learning experiences it offers, I would like to request your understanding in allowing me to register for course 82280, even though it is not the conventional way to do so. I been actively looking in the registration portal, but I am worried if I fail to register for the same since there are only limited seats. My aim is to leverage this opportunity to gain valuable insights and skills that will ultimately lead to a positive outcome at the end of the internship. ,  U28512729 \n",

Additionally, please let me know if there are any specific requirements or documentation that I need to fulfill for the deferral to be processed successfully.

      "Hi Official, I hope this email finds you well. My name is  and I, along with my wife, have recently enrolled in the Master's program- BAIS at USF for Fall 2023. We are immensely excited to be a part of this prestigious institution and are looking forward to a great learning experience. However, I am writing to you today to seek assistance with a concern that we are currently facing. We have noticed that our schedules and assigned professors are different, which poses a bit of a challenge for us. As we are new to the United States, we were hoping to attend the same classes, primarily to ease the logistical and emotional challenges associated with transitioning to a new country. We understand that the University has its processes and policies for allotting classes and professors, and we respect that. However, we kindly request if there might be a possibility to make some adjustments in our case. Attending the same classes, preferably under the same professors, would not only help us in terms of commuting and adjusting to a new academic environment but also provide mutual academic support. We are flexible with the subjects or the professors and are ready to adapt to the changes if it could align our schedules. I am sure there are many other students in a similar situation, and this change might be beneficial to them as well. We truly appreciate your understanding of our situation. If there is anything that we need to do from our end to facilitate this request, we are more than willing to do so. Please find my spouse details and her class schedule:  USF id : U14833410 !image001.pngthumbnail! My schedule: !image002.pngthumbnail! Kindly help to align my schedule and my spouse schedule.

We have set them up so that all incoming students can take the following classes QMB 6304 - Analytical Methods for Business ISM 6218 - Design ISM 6316 - Mining The first two have hard prerequisites (Statistics for QMB 6304 and Design and Development for ISM 6218), and we will not register you until you have satisfied those prerequisites. ISM 6316 has a soft prerequisite in object-oriented programming. It is essentially a class, and your chances of success in this class would bd greatly enhanced if you completed the OOP prerequisite. We have a and R boot camp before orientation but the bootcamp is more of a refresher for students who already know and R. Since I cannot find a suitable class for you to satisfy the database prerequisite, one option would be for you to take the online class that was mentioned in the file that I sent you. We could then register you for the class and for the undergraduate courses that you can use to satisfy the Statistics, OOP and Systems Analysis and Design prerequisites. Obviously, if you can get more prerequisites taken care of before the start of the semester, we can then register you for the relevant MS BAIS courses. Let me know if you still want to set up a Zoom call. I am taking a few days off but we should be able to meet any day after Tuesday.

The bad news is that they tell me you must be enrolled in a minimum of 3 graduate courses, and the idea of getting you to only take undergraduate courses will therefore not fly. The good news is that we have graduate courses that we can use to help you meet your prerequisites. The plan is to enroll you in ISM 6021 (CRN 80662) to fulfill the SAD prerequisite QMB 6305 (CRN 80685) to fulfill the Stats Prerequisite ISM 6316 (CRN 80334) Project Management to get the third graduate course. This course would count towards your degree ISM 3232 (CRN 81298) to fulfill the OOP prerequisite.

      "Hi Tasmin, I tried to register you but there are two problems: First, I get a message “Student Status Prohibits Registration.” I have never seen this before and I therefore do not know how to resolve it. Can you contact the registrar to find out what this means and what we can do about it? Second, there is no undergraduate database course with seats, other than courses offered in St Pete and Sarasota. I assume you do not want to travel to those campuses. If you do, let me know and I will add those to the set of courses; if not, you may want to just bite the bullet and do the online course.

      "Sir and/or Madam, My name is   (U-ID number: U08015717) who recently just got admitted to the MS-BAIS program in Fall 2023 at the University of South Florida. I would like to first start this email with a thank you to the MS-Business Analytics & Information Systems (MS-BAIS) Admission team, especially Dr.  and Ms. , as well as the Office of Graduate Admissions, for going to length and get my application process right back on track after the technical incident that has happened to my application. I truly appreciate all of your help and dedication in setting my record straight and getting me enrolled immediately this Fall. Words cannot describe my gratitude as I'm sure it was no easy task. However, it is my deepest regret to say that after my recent conversation with the Office of International Services (OIS) and some immense consideration, I have decided to defer my enrollment to the USF MS-BAIS program to Spring 2024 instead of Fall 2023. The reason for this decision is, as I walked into the OIS to gain more information about next steps of enrollment for international students, I found out that with me currently working at Masonite Corporation on my OPT, I have officially broken my continuous study on my I-20 paperwork. Given the fact, I now understand that I would not be able to work as a part-timer at Masonite for my first academic year while enrolled full-time in the graduate program. This also means that I would not be able to receive the financial support that my current employer could provide if I immediately enroll this Fall 2023. As a result, I have decided to utilize the full length of my OPT benefit and keep working for Masonite until the beginning of January 2024. This will allow me to gain a good amount of experience and money from my remaining time as an FTE at Masonite to afford the tuition in Spring, while also giving me some extra time to look for an assistantship position at USF that I can start in Spring 2024. Again, thank you so much for your help these past few weeks and please receive my sincere apology for the complication that I have caused. Given the situation stated above, I would like to request a deferment to my graduate enrollment to Spring 2024 and please inform me of any documentation I need to fill out in order to move this process forward. If you have any further concerns or questions, please feel free to reach me via this email or my USF email, . Yours, \n",

      "Hi Dr.  and School of Information System and Management, To introduce myself, my name is . I recently graduated from USF this May with a B.S. in Marketing. Currently, I am a Social Media intern at Jabil HQ in St. Petersburg. However, I am considering attending USF graduate school starting next Spring semester, specifically the M.S. BAIS program. I want to start my research and application as soon as possible; thus, I have some questions about the program: # Will I be eligible to attend this program? Although I do not have a background in information technology or coding, I am adaptable to new technology and digital tools (AI, data reporting and business management tools, etc.). As a Marketing graduate, I am also familiar with analytics and evaluating metrics to develop strategies and plans. Furthermore, I have basic knowledge of statistics and I am fairly good at Math (I got a 100% grade in Business Calculus, also I know the course was pretty easy). I will attach my resume in this email. # What would be my application deadline? Basically, I am an international student under the F-1 visa. However, I am currently living and working in the U.S. Would my deadline be August 1 like an international students or November 1 like a domestic student. # Can my GRE requirements be waived? I graduated from USF with a GPA of 3.96. I understand that my degree is not directly related to information systems or business analytics, yet my field does include somewhat similar activities: marketing research, research analysis, social media analytics, etc. # Would you recommend self-learning coding before enrolling? Or should I take prerequisite courses at USF? My graduation date would be late, but personally that would not be my concern. # Do you have more information or know the best way to learn about USF tuition waiver? For example, if I enroll in grad school, and also work as a TA or research assistant (probably in the marketing field since I have a background for it), how much of my tuition will be waived? And how complicated is the application process? I know this is a quite overloaded email. I want to pursue this degree because a M.S. in BAIS will bring about tremendous value for my future career. Thank you for helping me answer these questions! Best regards,    Digital Marketing Graduate University of South  Email:  Phone: (317)712-6059\n",

      "Director I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you as an enthusiastic prospective student who has recently been admitted to the University of South Florida for the upcoming academic year. Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to be part of such a prestigious institution. However, I am facing an unforeseen challenge in obtaining my visa, which I believe may hinder my ability to arrive on campus by the scheduled date of August 14th. to a delay in the availability of visa slots, I was only able to secure an appointment for August 14th. I understand the importance of adhering to the university's policies and deadlines, and I genuinely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I am extremely committed to pursuing my studies at the University of South Florida, and I am willing to take any necessary steps to ensure that I can start the course this year. To demonstrate my dedication, I am ready to enroll in extra accredited courses in India during the period of my extended arrival, which will aid me in further preparing for my master's program. These additional courses will not only enhance my knowledge but also ensure that I am well-prepared for the rigorous academic curriculum at your esteemed university. Furthermore, I am also willing to participate in the bootcamp course offered by the university during the first week, albeit remotely. If there is any possibility of attending the bootcamp online or through any other means, I am more than willing to make the necessary arrangements to ensure I can fully engage with the university's academic activities from afar. I understand that granting an arrival extension is subject to the university's policies and regulations, and I assure you that I will diligently comply with any requirements or conditions set forth by the university. If there are any additional steps or documentation needed from my end to facilitate this request, please let me know, and I will promptly provide them. Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this request. I genuinely hope that the University of South Florida will consider granting me an arrival extension of at least one week to accommodate my visa appointment. Your kind assistance and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  USF ID - \n",
      "Hi. Unfortunately, we cannot accept late arrivals. You will need to be here by the start of the semester at the very latest. If you arrive after the start of the semester, you may be denied entry by the immigration officer. If you cannot be here by August 19, and you can send us either your SEVIS receipt or your visa when you get it, we can defer you to the Spring. However, let me add that, in the past, applicants have been able to secure earlier visa slots than the ones they initially got. Also, you still have the insurance and immunization holds to clear at www.SHS.usf.edu. to be unhelpful.

      "Dr. , I am grateful for the time you've taken to evaluate my profile .I am writing to request a waiver for the prerequisite course in Analysis and Design, and Management, As I believe I have acquired substantial experience in Software Development Life Cycle, with over 3+ years of work experience in planning, defining, designing, building, testing, deployment of software utilizing methodology. Furthermore, I have gained extensive practical experience in database management, especially with SQL. I have frequently used DDL, DML, TCL , Join statements to recognize different types of databases. I have also optimized and designed complex database schemas, implemented efficient queries, and ensured data integrity across various projects. This experience has provided me with solid foundation in database management principles. To further support my request , i have attached my detailed resume , which highlights my relevant experience and technical skills. I understand that the prerequisite courses are planned to ensure that all the students have a common base of knowledge before beginning the program. However, I believe that my background and experience demonstrate that i already possess the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in Advance Analysis and Design and Management Essentials. Therefore, I kindly request that the admissions committee to review my request for waiver and consider granting me permission for waiving Analysis and Design and Management Essentials as prerequisite courses. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, \n",

      "Professor, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my keen interest in enrolling in Course ENT 6706 - Entrepreneurship as part of my master’s degree. Having carefully reviewed the course curriculum, I am genuinely enthusiastic about pursuing it as an elective to earn credits towards my degree. Allow me to share my sincere interest and inclination towards this course and how I believe it will significantly benefit my career. Over the past three years, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey by establishing two companies. One of these ventures was a beverage company, while the other focused on a Technology News article platform that provided content writers with an opportunity to showcase their work and earn income through post impressions. I am proud to say that both businesses yielded substantial profit margins. However, despite their initial success, I encountered challenges when it came to securing investors or venture capitalists to support their scalability. Eventually, I regrettably had to make the difficult decision to close both businesses after two years, even though they were profitable. It is precisely for these reasons that I am eager to take this course. I believe that by gaining a deep understanding of how to attract investors and secure funding for a business, I will be better equipped to navigate the challenges I faced previously. Moreover, I am keen to learn strategies for projecting market growth and effectively marketing a business on a global scale. I strongly believe that acquiring this knowledge will be instrumental in my future entrepreneurial endeavors. With all this in mind, I kindly request your consideration of my application for enrolment in Course ENT 6706 - Entrepreneurship. I am genuinely enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge in entrepreneurship under your esteemed guidance. Thank you for your time and consideration. I eagerly await your positive response. Sincerely, .\n",

Since my family and I are going through a financial crunch, I was hoping for an application fee waiver. to the same, I will apply for an educational loan if I get an admit.

      ", I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request information regarding the start date for the Spring 2024 semester. I have an important family event coming up – my sister's wedding in India, which is scheduled for last week in January 2024. Given the significance of this event, I am keen to plan my trip well in advance to ensure that I do not encounter any scheduling conflicts with my academic responsibilities. Understanding the start date of the Spring 2024 semester is crucial for me to make the necessary travel arrangements and coordinate with my professors to ensure that I do not miss any essential deadlines or classes. I want to ensure that I can fully commit to both my academic obligations and my family event without any conflicts. If you could provide me with the specific start date of the Spring 2024 semester or direct me to the appropriate department or resources where I can find this information, I would greatly appreciate it. This will enable me to plan my trip and academic schedule effectively, minimizing any potential disruptions. Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. I look forward to your response at your earliest convenience. If there are any other important dates or details related to the upcoming semester that I should be aware of, please feel free to include them in your response.

      "To Whom It May Concern, I hope you are doing well, and I hope you are looking forward to the weekend. My name is  and this December, I will be graduating with my undergrad in BAIS. Thankfully, I have recently accepted a job offer as a Analyst at a local non-profit/government contractor here in Tampa. Although the pay is below average (compared to the average starting salary for entry Analyst roles), I have accepted their offer because I consider securing a job before graduation a blessing (I tried my best to negotiate any part of the compensation, but it was no good). I mention this because, after some careful thought, I have decided to pursue a relevant master's degree at USF. Since I will already be living with my parents for a little longer, I would use my income towards the cost of the master's degree. From my preliminary research on the USF catalog, I am considering one of the three following programs:  Analytics and Information Systems, M.S.  Intelligence, M.S.D.I.  Administration, M.B.A., with concentration in Analytics # Could you give me some more insight into any of these programs beyond what is shown in the USF catalog? # I recently saw a sign on the 2nd floor of the CIS building that BAIS undergrad students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher do not need to take the GRE/GMAT for admission into the master's program. Could you provide more information on this? # Since I am a USF undergraduate BAIS senior, will any of my undergrad courses eliminate some of the prerequisites of any of the above degrees, thereby reducing the number of credits needed? # The application deadline for spring 2024 for each of these degrees is October 15th. Since I have not yet graduated with my undergraduate degree, am I still allowed to apply to one of these programs? Or do I have to wait until I complete my undergrad, and then apply for the next semester, which would be Summer? Finally, if there is someone specific that can better help me, please do let me know. I was considering scheduling an appointment with one of the MCOB advisors. Thank You,  Undergraduate Student - University of South Florida (813) 606-6129  LinkedIn !Outlook-20jzvz5u.pngthumbnail!\n",

That being said, I am writing you because I was hoping to get written confirmation from you regarding the error on the departments part during my class registration (as we discussed on teams) which partially resulted in me having to drop a course after the add/drop period. This confirmation from you will ensure I am not charged for those courses, will only pay for the two graduate courses I am currently registered for and can be correctly reimbursed by financial aid!

If I remember correctly, we signed you up for undergraduate classes on the understanding that this would not lead to any visa related issues, but since it did, we asked for the undergraduate classes to be dropped and to be changed to graduate classes. Is that correct? Han , PhD Graduate Coordinator MS BAIS, and Professor of Information Systems Muma College of Business University of South Florida\n",
      "Hi Professor , Of course - I completely understand. At this point, I am not sure why I was registered for undergraduate courses - I was never at risk for having visa issues. Regarding the graduate course that was dropped, I do know that  just accidentally registered me for the wrong course, and we had to remedy that. The issue I am currently having is related to financial aid. As a result of the errors in registration resulting in late drop, I am being forced to pay for the 3 courses I am not taking and was incorrectly registered for. After speaking to student billing services, I was informed that if I had confirmation from you regarding the errors, I would not be held responsible to pay for courses that I am not taking. I hope that clears things up a bit. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding! Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.  \n",

      "Hi , For context, I had applied for the fall 2023 and spring 2024 intakes of the same program(MS-BAIS) but unfortunately couldn't get admitted. The reason mentioned was that the seats fill up quickly. I understand I was late in applying for the fall 2023 intake. But, I was an early applicant for the spring intake. However, my admission was rejected for the same reason. Is it really the tight timelines? I request you to cross-check my application once again. If it is possible please let me know the exact reason for rejection. It would be very helpful for me to find out my areas of improvement. Thanks and regards  Software engineer CNX\n",

I have been working as a business and relations analyst at Fidelity Bank Plc for 3 years and I view this program as the next step in expanding my career.

Also, that English is the language of instruction in Nigeria, is there a possibility of an English test waiver?

After reaching out to Ms. few days back, for changing my course from M.S EE to M.S BAIS, I was told it would not be possible for the change in 2023 fall intake and was advised to apply for spring 2024 intake. As suggested, I have completed an application for Spring 2024 intake. I was informed that department of Electrical Engineering doesn't allow students to take the electives outside the department for the first semester. With all the positivity, I hope I would receive an admission.

For Fall 23 semester I registered for three courses (EIS-classroom, ERP & BPM-classroom, BCDR-online). If I get a fall internship which might start around September (I don't have an offer letter at the moment) may I know is there still possibility to pursue it by taking credit?

      "Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am currently in my final semester, I am faced with a critical situation regarding course registration and am hoping to seek your kind assistance. Regrettably, due to unfortunate circumstances, I was unable to secure a timely registration for two essential courses: \"Science Programming\" (CRN - 80148) and \"Warehousing\" (CRN - 88105). These courses are integral to my academic journey, particularly in the context of my future aspirations. Despite my diligent efforts, the registration window closed before I could secure a spot. Recently, I was fortunate to learn from a close friend that they are in the process of dropping the \"Science Programming\" course (CRN - 80148). The reason for their withdrawal is that they require only 2 more credits to fulfill their graduation requirements. This serendipitous opportunity presents a chance for me to enroll in a course that aligns perfectly with my academic and professional objectives. In light of these circumstances, I humbly request your assistance in facilitating my registration for the \"Science Programming\" course (CRN - 80148). Completing this course would not only be an essential step towards achieving my future goals but also mark the culmination of my journey in pursuing a master's degree. I truly understand the significance of your time and responsibilities, and I am genuinely grateful for any support you can provide in this matter. Your kind intervention would be a tremendous help to me, and I assure you that I will diligently engage in the course to maximize the benefits it offers.

If there are any specific procedures or information you require from my end, please do not hesitate to let me know. Thank you for your time, consideration, and unwavering support.

Having carefully reviewed the course curriculum and considering my background and professional experience, I am convinced that this course aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and past achievements. Allow me to provide a brief overview of my background LinkedIn Profile to help illustrate the alignment between my experience and the core objectives of the \"Chain Management\" course: Over the past 4 and a half years, I have thrived as a Project Management Professional in the Market Research domain. My roles have encompassed diverse responsibilities, from leading project setups and stakeholder management to optimizing processes and enhancing project efficiency. My proficiency in strategic planning, data analysis, and process improvement has enabled me to successfully manage complex projects, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and ensure high-quality project deliveries. Upon reviewing the course syllabus for \"Chain Management,\" I am excited to note the parallels between my professional journey and the course content. I believe that my experience in managing projects and analyzing data would greatly enhance my ability to excel in the course and contribute meaningfully to class discussions and assignments. As such, I would like to kindly request the opportunity to drop the course \"Big Data for Business\" and enroll in the \"Chain Management\" course instead. I understand this is a last-minute request and genuinely appreciate your consideration. Despite the timing challenges, I firmly believe enrolling in this course will significantly enhance my skill set and complement my project management expertise. Your guidance is invaluable to me and any advice on my enrollment would be highly valued. Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the timing of this request.

      ", I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to address an issue I have encountered with the Lean Six Sigma course registration and associated fees for the upcoming semester. Initially, I attempted to drop the Lean Six Sigma course from my schedule due to certain constraints. However, I was unable to proceed with the course drop process due to credit restrictions. Considering this, I reached out to  who is responsible for the Lean Six Sigma course, explaining my situation and requesting assistance in dropping the course. Unfortunately,  informed me that the credit restriction was also affecting her ability to process the drop for me. Given that this is my final semester, and I am nearing the completion of my degree requirements, I proceeded to apply for a reduced course load in accordance with the policies of the university. Simultaneously, I noticed that the system had automatically removed the Lean Six Sigma course from my schedule due to the \"Drop 1st Day Non-Attendance on Aug 14, 2023\" procedure. However, upon reviewing the summary of fees for the semester, I realized that the fee for the Lean Six Sigma course had not been adjusted accordingly. I kindly request your assistance in addressing this matter. It appears that while the course itself has been dropped from my schedule, the associated fee has not been updated to reflect this change.

      "Hi Professor Han, I hope you're doing well. Thanks for getting back to me about the Data Visualization course. I totally understand that it’s a bit early for me. But, I'd love to share a bit more about why I'm so keen. Over the past 5 years, I've been deep in the trenches of software development. From working on post-sales support applications at Service Now to designing payment processors at DBS in Singapore, I've been around the block a few times. And while I've loved every bit of it, I've started to notice something: the way we present and visualize data can make or break a project. I remember this one time at Hexagon India, where we were developing an Integrated Engine. The data was complex, and getting everyone on the same page was a challenge. It was then that I realized the power of effective data visualization. If only we could've visualized our data better, it would've saved us countless hours. That's why I'm so eager to dive into this course. Not just to add another skill to my toolkit, but because I genuinely believe it can change the way I approach my projects. And with the hands-on nature of the course you've designed, I can't think of a better place to learn. I totally respect your decision either way, but I thought it was worth sharing a bit more about myself. I have attached my resume. Thanks & Regards, Sirish (0.0 kB)\n",

I have taken and completed 2 courses in summer 2023 and now I have two courses left to complete my degree requirements, and I am considering taking one offline course in the upcoming Fall 2023 semester and the other offline course in the Spring 2024 semester. This arrangement would allow me to meet my graduation goal for Spring 2024. If yes, will it effect my F1 visa status. However, I wanted to confirm with you whether it is feasible to split my remaining courses across these two semesters in this manner. I am committed to managing my workload effectively and ensuring that I meet all the necessary course requirements within the given timeframe.

ISS is not entirely sure yet, as the SEVIS Guidance is constantly changing, but at the moment they expect that if you take only one course in the Fall semester, it cannot be an online course.

      "Hi Dr , May I please get registered for a few classes for this Fall Semester? You're right though, the workload with a full-time job was pretty rough since both classes needed extra study time to comprehend the materials. I still made As through great effort but we can lower my load to 2-3 classes if you feel it's necessary for my next semester. Thank you so much Dr. . Also, I included some background about my new role. If you have any input, I would appreciate it. I recently got my first quarter work review. I think they expected greater things from me, so instead of getting a positive first quarter review like I expected for doing good work, I got one stating I needed more initiative to be where the team wants me to be. I signed up for Senior Software Engineer, so it could also be that they see potential and are considering me for SE. So I'm focusing on more architectural changes and different standards, now that I have customer service and social skills better practiced. I believe it's also different from my previous start-up environments to a corporate one, especially when teamwork is concerned. In the start-ups, I would be focused on doing as much as I can quickly. now, I need to practice my team skills and develop the rest of my team in all of my current skill sets so that they may excel too. The \"move fast and break things\" mentality is also different, and they do not want the risk of seeing anything deployed even with the slightest chance of issues. I think one of the biggest issues holding me back was just moving fast, but I quickly changed to spend more time thoroughly looking through all of the code. I'm adapting quickly, so I hope they perceive my effort from their feedback over this next quarter as worthy of the promotion once my contract ends. Do you think I'm perceiving my feedback correctly & are focused on the correct solutions? Other than that, it's usually just custom code syntax or in-house got-yas that I'm quickly overcoming.

      "Dear Admissions Officer, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my strong interest in applying to the UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA for the business analytics and information systems program for spring 2024. I have researched your esteemed institution and find that it aligns perfectly with my academic and personal goals. I am a dedicated and passionate student with a strong academic record and a genuine desire to contribute positively to the USF . However, I find that the application fee poses a significant financial burden for me and my family. In light of this, I am respectfully requesting an application fee waiver to alleviate this financial constraint and enable me to submit a complete application to USF. I am confident that my qualifications and achievements make me a strong candidate for admission to USF , and I would be incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be considered for a fee waiver. As an aspiring BAIS major, I am eager to engage with the diverse academic programs and resources that university of USF offers. To provide some context for my fee waiver request, my family's financial situation has been challenging, and the costs associated with the application process and standardized tests have accumulated. Obtaining a fee waiver would significantly increase my chances of applying to and attending USF, which is my dream institution. Enclosed with this email, please find the necessary documentation supporting my financial circumstances. If there are any additional forms or documents required to process the fee waiver request, please let me know, and I will promptly provide them. I assure you that, if granted this fee waiver, I will approach the application process with the utmost dedication and seriousness, working diligently to present a comprehensive and compelling application that reflects my true potential and passion for learning. Thank you for considering my request. I sincerely appreciate your time and attention to this matter.

I am writing to provide an update on my visa application process and inquire about the holds on my account, as well as the prerequisites for my desired course. I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed my visa interview and have been granted approval to study at the University of South Florida (USF). I am excited to start my academic journey at USF and look forward to joining the vibrant community on campus. As I prepare for my enrolment, I would like to request information about the holds currently on my account and the necessary steps to remove them. Specifically, I am aware of holds related to immunization and insurance requirements. Please guide me on where I can access the details of these holds and the procedure to fulfil these requirements, so I can clear them as soon as possible. Additionally, I want to ensure that there are no other holds on my account that might hinder my enrolment process. let me know if there are any additional holds that I need to address promptly. Furthermore, I am aware of a prerequisite hold on my account that involves a course in statistics. Unfortunately, I have not completed this course yet. I am eager to know if there are any alternative courses that I could take to fulfil this prerequisite, or if I should plan to take the subject with a statistics prerequisite during the upcoming spring semester. Taking the course in the spring semester would provide me with ample time to complete the prerequisites and ensure a smooth registration process. Lastly, I am eager to register for my classes at the earliest opportunity. inform me about the registration schedule for incoming students, so I can secure my desired courses and create a well-planned academic schedule.

      "Dear Admission Council, USF ID-U47885288 Applied for fall 2023 I am writing to express my continued interest in pursuing a MS BAIS program at the University of Florida. I was recently notified that my application has been placed on the waitlist, and I wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm my passion for the program and my dedication to pursuing a career in business analytics. I am particularly drawn to the University of Florida's S BAIS program because of its focus on developing a deep understanding of the technical skills required for data analysis, as well as the practical knowledge needed to apply those skills to business problems. The program's emphasis on case studies and project-based learning is particularly appealing to me, as I believe that these experiences will prepare me well for the challenges of working in this rapidly evolving field. Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong interest in using data to drive business outcomes. I am excited about the potential of the MS BAIS program to help me build on this passion and acquire the skills and knowledge I need to succeed in this field. I am confident that the program's rigorous curriculum, dedicated faculty, and diverse student body will provide me with the opportunities I need to grow both personally and professionally. I hope to be on the top priority if there is any opportunity to consider me for the admission. Thank you for considering my application, and for placing me on the waitlist. I am eager to contribute my skills and experience to the University of Florida community, and I remain committed to pursuing my goals of obtaining a MS BAIS degree.

      "Hi, I'm a fall 2023 prospective student applied for MS in BAIS program. My application has been put on waitlist as per the latest communication from USF. Name:   USF ID: U42399336 I'm writing this in regard if my application wasn't shortlisted basis on GRE scores. Earlier, I submitted the application without any GRE scores because I have not given an in-centre based test and most universities are not accepting home based GRE test. Later, I came to know that USF is accepting home based GRE scores. Hence, I have sent my official GRE scores to the college. However, my application has been put on hold. So, It'd be really helpful if you could reconsider my application along with the scores that I have sent. I couldn't take GRE in centre as in 2021 there are still some restrictions due to Covid outbreak and also due to family obligations. Thus I opted for home based test. I would like you to consider and evaluate my profile holistically as I have always displayed academic excellence throughout my education. I'm also recipient of merit based scholarships and government aid during my diploma and btech. Apart from that, MS BAIS offered by USF is a unique program that I couldn't find elsewhere. I'm currently working on Enterprise resource planning with SAP in Accenture and when I researched for programs where I could fit it data science with some management and BAIS program is such rare one I found. The course curriculum is exactly what I'm looking for achieving my academic/career goals. I'm optimistic about pursuing BAIS program at USF. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks and , .

      "Hi, Our academic director looks at a large number of factors in making the decision whether to accept an application or out them on a waiting list, including undergraduate degree (both major and the university it was earned from), work experience, and, in some cases GRE. He takes a dim view of applicants who claim that they received a waiver when he knows we did not grant the waiver. I am not sure why he decided to shortlist you but you might want to look at the admission criteria on our web site and see where you might be able to improve your chances of being accepted in the future.

However, I am writing to request a deferral of my admission As much as I am looking forward to starting my college journey, unforeseen circumstances have arisen that have made it difficult for me to enroll for the Fall 23 term.

Here is my NetID: princepraveen ( U62327509 ) I hope that you along with the admissions committee will consider my request for a deferral, and I am more than willing to provide any additional information that might be required to support my request. Once again, I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of USF's community and I look forward to hearing from you.

If you decide to apply to the MS BAIS program, then once we admit you, we can transfer up to 9 credit hours from CS to the MS BAIS program but we would have to evaluate the various courses you would like to transfer.

I am attaching the curriculum of the training course to this email for your reference. While it was not taken at the university level, I feel confident that I have a strong foundation in the subject matter and am prepared to succeed in this course. So, I request you to kindly exempt me from the corresponding pre-requisite courses for statistics. Meanwhile, I have completed the course(BUS103: Introduction to Accounting as a prerequisite for Accounting.

However, we might be able to waive it based on the Great Learning Course. However, I need some more details. In particular, how long did the course take and was your performance in the course assessed through an exam or a project. With kind regards, , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",
      "Professor, Thank you for the response. 1. The statistics module was a part of a course \"Introduction to Machine Learning\" during my training and the minimum time to be dedicated to the statistics module alone is 20 to 24 Hrs including videos, reading material, and self-paced practice exercises. 2. For grading, there were two assessments. · Graded – MCQs with 20 Multiple choice questions carrying 1 mark for each question. · Graded Project (50 Marks) which further has two parts. 1. Problems on Probability and Statistics, Testing. (20 Marks) 2. development for a health insurance problem statement. (30 Marks) I am attaching the corresponding snapshots for your reference. I hope this information would suffice. let me know in case you need further details. Sincerely,  !Grading.pngthumbnail! !overview.pngthumbnail!\n",

I had considered USF as my first priority as it ranks as one of the best institutions in the country, also, BAIS is offered by very few colleges which indicates how unique the institution is. I was aware of the requirements, and keeping that in mind I had completed my application beforehand i.e., Sept 2022. I respect your selection process and I would appreciate your help in moving my application forward. Sincerely hoping that my request would be considered.

      "Hi, I am  (USF ID: U93298968, Number: VZ1245282). I have applied to a Masters in business analytics and information systems course for fall 2023 and I have also filled out the form (USF MS BAIS Application Supplement Fall 2023) which has been provided by the USF university through email (link)... With due respect, I have initially applied to MS BAIS program for January 2022 intake previously in September 2022 but I did not receive any admission decision from the department, which ultimately led me to shift to Fall 2023 intake. I would also like to let you know that I have booked the appointment on April 24th and 25th for the biometrics and visa interview. To pursue masters in the USA, I am going for a bank loan in India. When I discussed this with my bank manager today, I was informed that I have to give my admission decision details along with I-20 as early as possible to obtain all financial documents (loan) from the bank to be able to attend the visa interview. As the date is very close to attending for visa interview and the bank loan process in India, I would request you to provide me with an admission decision for MS BAIS as early as possible, so that I wouldn't miss joining the course in USF(BAIS). Though I have I-20s from other universities for business analytics in the USA, my first choice is to join USF for Fall 2023 intake as the BAIS coursework from USF is really interesting. I know I have been sending emails to you continuously(regularly), but I would sincerely request you to kindly understand my situation and provide the admission decision as early as possible. I hope you can understand my scenario. Kind Regards, \n",

According to the website, the deadline for international students is 2/1 for the fall semester which means I will have to apply for the spring semester if interested.

      "Graduate Coordinator, MS BAISMuma College of Business, University of South Florida, I am writing to request a waiver of prerequisite courses. As a highly motivated and driven individual, I believe that I possess the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in this program, despite not having completed the required prerequisite courses. During my professional career in Consultancy Services for the past 1.8 years, I am able to work closely with Business Analysts. In order to cope up with them, I was made to learn the fundamentals of Business Analytics and that includes Management and Analysis & Design. While I understand that the prerequisite courses are designed to prepare students for the rigors of Master's ProgramBAIS, I am confident that I have acquired the necessary knowledge and skills through my professional experience. I was given two prerequisites to be completed. They are 1.Management. 2. Analysis & Design. Regarding these prerequisites I had completed some certifications which I am including the certificates directly and some training for which there are no certificates and hence sharing the training shot for the web. Note: These Trainings which I had taken were certified by Consultancy Services which is highly reputed and hence can be believed to have certain standards in their content even though there is no certificate for it. 1.Management. # CertificateOfCompletionMTADatabaseFundamentals98364CertPrep1CoreConcepts( Certification from linked in Learning). # Administration (DBMS) -(present in Screenshot 2) # Technology. -(present in Screenshot 2) # Management. -(present in Screenshot 2) 2.Analysis & Design # Design Principles. -(present in Screenshot 1,2) # Design Patterns. -(present in Screenshot 2) # Oriented Analysis And Design. -(present in Screenshot 2) # Usability Analysis and Design. -(present in Screenshot 2) # Business Analysis -(present in Screenshot 1) I would like to request a waiver of these prerequisite courses so that I may focus my efforts on the core coursework and make the most of my time in the program. I am eager to begin my studies and contribute to the University of South Florida community. Hoping for a positive response and please give me the decision on these waivers soon so that I need to complete them if needed. Thank you for your time and consideration of my request.

I also completed 33 credits in undergraduate education under Administration and Desk certification at Hillsborough Community College. I have 5 years of experience in Service Development at DCF.

I am currently in QMB 6304 and 2 undergrad classes as pre-requisites, ISM 4212 DB Design and and ISM 4641 Python for Business Analytics. At this time, I think I want to pursue a Data Science path.

      "Hi Professor, I am writing to request a waiver for my prerequisites for the courses Design and Object-Oriented Programming.  For Oriented Programming prerequisite: During my Undergraduate 3rd semester, I completed a course on Oriented Programming and Structures using C. And additionally, I have obtained a certification in Programming, Structures, and Algorithms using from NPTEL and a Microsoft certification in Programming in C#.  Furthermore, For Design/systems: I have completed Microsoft certifications in Administering a SQL Infrastructure and Provisioning SQL Databases. I also have development work experience in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and Microsoft Azure SQL in all the SQL commands like DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, and DQL. I believe my previous coursework, certifications, along with my experience would be considered. I have also attached my Microsoft Certification transcript for your reference. Thank you for your time and consideration. If you require any further information or documentation, please let me know. Thanks, .\n",
      "Hi, I looked at the record again, and my original email was wrong: The prerequisites I should have assigned you were  Database Design-- This has to be completed before you can take Database Systems  Economics  Financial Accounting I did see your Microsoft certificates but they are in database administration, not in database design and development. You will need to give me more details about the database development work you have done before I can waive the DB prerequisite. Let me add: I am not doing this to be difficult; I am doing this to make sure you will be successful in our program. With kind regards, , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",
      "Hi Professor, Thank you for getting back to me and providing the updated information regarding the prerequisites. I appreciate your attention to detail and commitment to ensuring my success in the program. I understand that my certifications do not cover the specific prerequisite of Database Design. However, I believe that my extensive experience in database development may qualify me to waive this requirement. I have worked with Dynamics ERP for the past four years, and its tables are connected to an on-premise SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) database. From the Dynamics ERP system, I can extract data from the database, whether through a user interface, a report, or a custom query, give relations to multiple tables, and manipulate the data, such as creating new records, updating existing records, or deleting records stored in the on-premise database as needed per my project requirement, allowing for real-time updates and synchronization between the ERP system and the database. To highlight my experience further on SQL, I recently had a requirement where I needed to migrate 4 million user profiles from the Dynamics on-premise database (SSMS) to SQL. The migration required me to select a particular set of records, manipulate data, add new columns to the table, and update it with values from multiple tables using joins, providing necessary constraints to fields, and moving tables from one database to another. Further, I had to create new databases and tables in Dynamics on-premise and Azure. For performing complex updates and insertions of records in the table, I used batch-wise updates and insert queries. I have also used a variety of techniques for moving and inserting data in the database, such as using a bacpac file, importing as a table in the database, and generating scripts of tables. I believe my experience in database development demonstrates my proficiency in the subject matter, and I hope you will consider waiving the prerequisite of Database Design for me. Again, thank you for your time and effort in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks, \n",
      "Hi, I still do not see any real SQL work. For example, importing an Excel file as a table does not require you to use SQL. I also do not see any real database design experience. Nevertheless, I will waive the DB prerequisite. With kind regards, , PhD Professor and Graduate Coordinator, MS BAIS College of Business, University of South Florida\n",

      "Hi , Thanks for getting back to me. I will keep tracking the status on OASIS. However, the issue is not resolved as I see some issues with the admission status. I have applied for the MS BAIS program, Fall 2023 and my application number is VZ1295431. I also got the acceptance email from MSBAIS Communications recently. However, I have also received an acceptance email from USF Graduate Admissions for MS Computer Science program, Fall 2023. There seems to be some confusion since I have not submitted the application for Computer Science. Also, the application status page shows 'Completed & Submitted' status for both the programs. I intend to go for the MS BAIS program, Fall 2023 for which I have applied and got the acceptance email. Does it mean I would not get the admit and I20 processing for BAIS program if the Computer science application shows ADMITTED? Please help me here and let me know if any further information is required. Thanks and ,  +91 9080157223\n",
