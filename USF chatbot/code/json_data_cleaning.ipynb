eligibility for a graduate assistantship and my financial constraints i from a small and beautiful country nepal i studied at a community school in my hometown and came third in class 10th a school leaving examination something i very proud of is that i the first computer engineer from my hometown and i want to take this further by achieving an ms degree in business analytics and information systems at the university of south florida i highly motivated to work on the application of deep learning to big data analytics and find solutions to the challenges involved as deep learning can be utilized in big data to address problems such as extracting complex patterns from massive volumes of data semantic indexing data tagging fast information retrieval and simplifying discriminative tasks it can bring breakthroughs in big data research though deep learning has been utilized in speech recognition computer vision and natural language processing there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully utilize deep learning in big data analytics i would like to work on issues such as scalability interpretability and security so that we can fully harness the power of deep learning in big data analytics i will be very thrilled and excited to work on these amazing research areas related to the program my background includes a bachelor s degree in computer engineering to be honest though my overall cgpa was not the best due to university calendar issues the 2015 earthquake the border blockade and other reasons i got an a in artificial intelligence after completing my bachelors degree i kicked off my career in the fields of data engineering data warehousing data analysis and business intelligence i was involved in some pioneering projects in the business intelligence domain in nepal s private sector over the past five years i have worked on numerous data related projects of different magnitudes and especially while working in a bank and at

technologies such as ai and this will only increase in the coming years moreover i believe my degree would be of great value for my home country where data driven decision making is still in its infancy after completing the program i plan to work as an educator sharing my knowledge and expertise with the next generation of data enthusiasts i believe i an excellent fit for a graduate assistantship because i have a related degree in computer engineering and have gained not exactly the same but similar experience over the past five years in the data sector more specifically i have a very good knowledge of academic research writing i have taken 20 hours of courses related to research methods and approaches additionally having lived in different parts of the country as a student and a worker and transacted with people from all walks of life i possess strong communication collaboration and leadership skills i a proficient user of english with demonstrated ielts academic cefr level c1 as i truly believe in lifelong learning i have completed various courses related to it business and management that would definitely add value while working as a graduate assistant moreover i have also taken extensive and specific courses related to the program such as for science and learning bootcamp spss statistics essential training and many others unfortunately i facing financial challenges as i do not come from a very strong financial background and my savings were spent on funding my brothers education therefore i seeking opportunities for funding or a graduate assistantship
